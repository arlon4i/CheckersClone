<b>What happens when I deny Checkers permission to use my current location?</b>
<br><br>
The Checkers app will not be able to display the specials, EeziCoupons and stores relevant to your region and this will have to be done manually by filtering by region. In order to select your preferred store, the Checkers app must be able to use your current location.
