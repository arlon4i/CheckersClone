<b>How do EeziCoupons work?</b>
<br><br>
You can browse all of the available EeziCoupons from within our app. 
You can get your EeziCoupon WiCode when you go into EeziCoupons on the app and press "Redeem All" or by pressing "Redeem All" on your Home Screen under EeziCoupons. 
<br><br>
You can visit any Checkers or Checkers Hyper store to buy the products that have EeziCoupons assigned to them. Once your items have been scanned at the till, tell the cashier that you have an EeziCoupon WiCode. Enter your EeziCoupon WiCode into the PIN pad at the till and save on the EeziCoupon products.
