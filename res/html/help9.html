You will need to have cell phone coverage and data available in order to generate your EeziCoupon WiCode. If you have already generated your EeziCoupon WiCode, it will be stored in your app and you can retrieve it without network coverage being available. Ensure that you use this EeziCoupon WiCode within 24 hours, thereafter a new EeziCoupon WiCode can be generated. You need to bring your cell phone with your EeziCoupon WiCode to the store to be used at the till point.
