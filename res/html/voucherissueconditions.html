		Voucher Offer Restrictions
		</br></br>
		Unless expressly stated otherwise –
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>Only South African residents may take up Voucher offers. We may ask you to provide adequate proof in respect of this requirement;</li>
			<li>Only persons over the age of 18 and able to conclude binding contracts may subscribe and participate in our Voucher offers.  We may ask you to provide adequate proof in respect of this requirement;</li>
			<li>No more than one Voucher per person and household will be available under any Voucher offer;</li>
			<li>Each Voucher may be redeemed only once;</li>
			<li>A Voucher is not transferable.  It may therefore only be redeemed by the person to whom it was issued unless we give our written consent for the Voucher to be transferred to another person;</li>
			<li>Only one Voucher will be redeemed per product purchased from us;</li>
			<li>A Voucher may not be used in conjunction with any other special offer, promotion, voucher or coupon unless this is specifically permitted in the relevant Voucher Terms;</li>
			<li>Vouchers cannot be redeemed against prior purchases;</li>
			<li>
				Your participation in a Voucher offer may be subject to additional criteria (e.g. a minimum age) with which you will need to comply.  Examples:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>If a Voucher applies only to specific stores, you may not redeem it at any other stores;</li>
					<li>If the Voucher applies only to certain specified products, you may not redeem it against any other products;</li>
					<li>If the Voucher may be redeemed during a certain period, you may not redeem it during any other period;</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash or for other vouchers of any kind. No change will be paid out if the value of the products for which the Voucher is used is less than the value of the Voucher;</li>
			<li>Vouchers cannot be used to pay for taxes, shipping and handling or other charges which may apply to the purchase of the products to which Voucher relates.</li>

		Subscription and Issuing of Vouchers
		</br>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>
				Before you can become eligible to participate in our Voucher offers, you will be required to complete the prescribed subscription process, subject to the following:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>By subscribing you agree that we may communicate with you concerning Voucher offers and promotions that may be of interest you;</li>
					<li>You may notify us at any time if you want us to stop sending you such communications.  This may be done by sending us an email at <u>blowe@shoprite.co.za</u> or <u>hkoster@shoprite.co.za</u>.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>We may from time to time make available certain Vouchers for certain products or stores as described in the relevant Voucher Terms. You may submit requests to take up such Vouchers by completing our automated Voucher issuing process in the prescribed manner.  The process will provide you with an opportunity to review the request, to correct mistakes and to cancel each request before finally submitting it. Please make sure that the all details are correct before submitting the request. We may restrict the number of Vouchers to be issued to you and/or your household to discourage unfair practices.</li>
			<li>
				Once submitted, your request will constitute an offer to participate in the relevant Voucher offer on the terms and conditions contained in these terms of use and the applicable Voucher Terms.  It is your duty to review the applicable Voucher Terms before submitting a request.  Your offer is open for acceptance by us.  We reserve the right not to accept or process your request for a Voucher and we will try to notify you if this is the case. In particular, we may refuse to issue Vouchers to you under offers for which you do not meet the specified qualification criteria.  This includes instances where –
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>The law prescribes a minimum age for certain products and you are younger than the minimum age;</li>
					<li>An offer is limited to a certain geographical area and you do not live in that area to which the offer applies;</li>
					<li>The Voucher stock under the offer is exhausted; or</li>
					<li>The number of Vouchers issued to you exceeds any applicable limit.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>
				Once we accept your offer, a legally binding contract will come into existence.  We will then send you a notice confirming that your offer has been accepted.  Such notice will be accompanied by the relevant Voucher.  Please note that, while we will try to send the confirmation notice for every properly submitted Voucher request, we cannot guarantee that –
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>The notice or the accompanying Voucher will be received by you, or</li>
					<li>If the notice and related Voucher(s) are received by you, they will be legible and uncorrupted</li>
				</ol>
				Please contact us if you experience any problems during the issuing process as they will not affect the validity of our contract.
			</li>
			<li>We will keep all records of Vouchers issued to you.  You will be able to access your record of valid Vouchers by submitting an email request for such information to blowe@shoprite.co.za or hkoster@shoprite.co.za for as long as the Vouchers remain valid.</li>

	<li>
		Voucher Redemption
		</br>
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>Each Voucher that you acquire from us creates a right to obtain a defined discount on specific products available for sale at our retail stores during our trading hours only.  The Voucher may, however, only be redeemed –
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>By the person to whom it has been issued, and</li>
					<li>Where all the applicable Voucher Terms (including any restrictions which may be stated) have been fulfilled.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>We will not re-issue damaged, lost or stolen Vouchers. Your Voucher will typically contain unique identification numbers, barcodes and/or access codes which will make sure that each Voucher is redeemed only once. No Voucher may be redeemed without such information being made available.</li>
			<li>We may ask that you provide us with suitable evidence of your right to use the Voucher before you may redeem it.  We are not obliged to redeem Voucher under the following circumstances –
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>Where the Voucher was issued to you by mistake;</li>
					<li>Where the Voucher is manifestly incorrect;</li>
					<li>Where redeeming the Voucher would be illegal;</li>
					<li>Where redeeming the Voucher would be practically impossible where, for example, our computer systems are not functioning properly or the product to which the Voucher applies is unavailable for any reason.  If the product to which the Voucher applies is unavailable when you try to redeem the Voucher, we will source the product from another outlet within 48 hours at the same promotional price.</li>

			<li>SHOULD WE FOUND TO BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM(S) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VOUCHER OR ANY RELATED INFORMATION, OUR LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE VOUCHER INVOLVED, REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR OUR LIABILITY, WHETHER IT STEMS FROM CONTRACT, STATUTE OR DELICT, SAVE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</li>
